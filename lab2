How is the accuracy of the validation set affected if we increase the percentage of validation set? What happens when we reduce it?
ANS:if we increase the percentage of validation set,accuracy of the validation set increases.if we decrease the percentage of validation set,accuracy of the validation set decreases
2. How does the size of the train and validation set affect how well we can predict the accuracy on the test set using the validation set?
ANS:1.the accuracy of validation set should be more to get good output,for good accuracy there should be large data set
2.if the accuracy of validation set is high,we get expect accurate output of test data set
3. What do you think is a good percentage to reserve for the validation set so that thest two factors are balanced? 
ANS:45%
